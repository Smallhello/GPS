# GPS

Global Pathway Selection (GPS) is an algorithm that effectively generates reduced (skeletal) chemistry mechanisms, ​which speeds up your simulations.

To improve the accuracy of reduced mechanisms, GPS considers all-generation relation between species, and minimizes the risk of broken pathway or dead-end issue. 

This algorithm is developed by Prof. Wenting Sun's group at Georgia Tech.
